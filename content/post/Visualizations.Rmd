# Introduction

This is a place for some of my favourite data visualizations I've done, and can post without breaking workplace NDAs!  

# Valorant

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width= "35%"}
knitr::include_graphics("PvsV.png")
knitr::include_graphics("MastersWR.png")
knitr::include_graphics("MastersPistols.png")
