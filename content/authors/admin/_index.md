Hi I'm Khizer! (pronounced Kh-zer)

A recent graduate seeking a professional or research position, I am keen on pursuing a career in Data Science and/or Public Policy, with the goal of improving human welfare. I have experience working in consulting and non-profits, and currently hold the position of Data Analyst based out of Toronto. My research interests are quite diverse and include Education, Political Economy, and History, with an a strong component of quantitative analysis. 

My current work involves surveying and data mining, for a more comprehensive list of my competencies please refer to my CV. I greatly value effective communication, some examples of my work can be found in the blog section, where I share some of my personal data focused projects. In addition to this, I am very passionate about Esports, and freelance as a coach/commentator in my spare time.
